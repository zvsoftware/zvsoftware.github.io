                Excellent working with this person. On time delivery. Responds quickly, hard working, efficient and meets your needs. I would definitely recommend working with him. I've dealt with quite a few people in this field and I've had the best experience and final product with him.

                Good developer - and adept at listening to the business requirements.

                Tim came up with several ideas for improving my site's design and I'm happy I went with him on this project. He was very responsive, easy to talk to, and he made sure that I was fully satisfied before we marked this project complete. I highly recommend him.

                He is very easy to chat with - VERY good at getting the coding done fast - and communicates well. I strongly recommend x 10.
